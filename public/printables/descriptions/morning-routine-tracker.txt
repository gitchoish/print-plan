Transform your mornings and supercharge your productivity with this Morning Routine Tracker. "Win the morning, win the day" is the philosophy behind this layout, designed to help you build positive habits from the moment you wake up.

The tracker is split into two powerful sections. The left side features a timeline from 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM, allowing you to time-block your crucial first hours. Whether it's meditation, exercise, or a healthy breakfast, you can schedule it efficiently. The "Priorities" section ensures you identify your top 3 goals before the day gets busy.

On the right, the "Habit Stack" grid lets you track key behaviors like hydration, reading, or journaling over a full week. Seeing your streak build up provides visual motivation to keep going. Clean, professional, and minimal, this tracker is the tool you need to stop hitting snooze and start intentional living. Download it now and take control of your AM routine.
