Visualize your workflow and boost team productivity with the Project To-Do Board. Inspired by the Kanban method, this printable template turns your tasks into a clear, manageable visual system.

The board is divided into three classic columns: "To Do / Backlog," "In Progress," and "Completed." This flow allows you to see exactly where every task stands at a glance. Each "task card" area includes a priority indicator, letting you circle the urgency level. It's perfect for tracking personal projects, freelance work, or small team assignments.

This analog version of a digital board offers a tangible satisfaction that apps can't match. moving a task to the "Completed" column is a rewarding physical action. Simple, structured, and effective, this Project To-Do Board keeps you focused on execution and delivery.
